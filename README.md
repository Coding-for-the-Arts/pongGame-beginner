# pongGame - Beginner 
The task is to program the game `Pong`. We want to program a simple game with random movement and user input of the mouse. These basic building blocks will later help us to develop our own mouse game.

## Pong Game
![](/img/pong.png)

Pong was released by Atari in 1972 and was the first commercially successful game. Today, Pong is considered the game that started the video game industry.

The game principle of Pong is simple: A dot (ball) moves back and forth on the screen. Each of the two players controls a vertical line (racket), which he can move up and down with a bar (paddle). If the ball passes the paddle, the opponent receives a point. [Original Atari PONG (1972).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiShX2pTz9A)

## Setup
![](/img/code.png)
1. First, you need to create your own repository on Github (only one person).  
2. After that you have to share it with the second person on GitHub under `Settings-> Manage Access -> Direct Access -> Invite Members`.
3. Now both should be able to edit and clone the still empty repository. 

After you have created a repository, you still need to create 3 files and add them to your repository (Preferably locally in your cloned repository and then push). You can set this up yourself or copy the code from the appropriate files from this repository.  

1. `index.html` -> Here the game is displayed 
2. `pong.js` -> Here we write the game logic resp. the code
3. `style.css` -> Here the styles for the html-file are defined

### Assistance
You can find the help in the file `pong.js`. Copy them directly into your project or look them up if you need some tips. 

### Show Pong Game 
To see what you have programmed, open the index.html file in your browser (right click or drag'n'drop). 
This could look like this:

## Additional
If you want, you can extend or change your Pong game as you like. You are not bound to the style of the 70s.
* Try to add your own style to the pong game (e.g. blurred movements, the ball draws a track, bright colors, etc.).
* Let the ball become faster and faster and the game more and more difficult.
* Program an opponent\*in. For the sake of simplicity, this opponent is "dumb" and will also be operated by you.
